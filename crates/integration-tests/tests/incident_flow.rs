//! Golden regression: a synthetic 502 incident. Piping the toolbox the
//! way we would during triage must still rediscover the known peak.
//!
//! `events.txt` is the raw stream; `expected.txt` is burst's summary block for
//! the incident window. We compare the summary (the *finding*), not the histogram
//! bars (cosmetic). If you change burst's summary format on purpose, regenerate:
//!
//!     cat events.txt \
//!       | window --from 2026-09-03T10:21:29+09:00 --to 2026-09-03T10:21:33+09:00 \
//!       | burst | awk 'f{print} /^$/{f=1}' > expected.txt
