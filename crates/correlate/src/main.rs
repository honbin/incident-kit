correlate — how often two timestamped event streams co-occur in time

usage:
    correlate <A> <B> [--window <dur>]

Reads one RFC3339 timestamp per line from files A and B, and reports — in both
directions — what fraction of one stream's events have an event in the other
within ±window. --window accepts 5s / 2m / 1h / bare seconds (default 1s).

example:
    correlate 502.txt sigterm.txt --window 5s";
