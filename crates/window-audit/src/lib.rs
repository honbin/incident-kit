//! Core logic for `window-audit`: report where observed events sit inside a
//! requested time window, plus one fetch-condition signal.
//!
//! It reports *facts*, never a verdict or a cause. A gap only says "nothing was
//! observed between this window edge and the nearest event" — not whether events
//! existed there and were lost. `LIMIT_REACHED` only says "the input rows reached
//! the stated cap" — not that the fetch was truncated (exactly `limit` rows may
//! simply exist), and rows dropped upstream before this input are invisible to it.
//! Kept free of I/O so it can be unit-tested without spawning the binary.
